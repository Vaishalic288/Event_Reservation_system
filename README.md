# Event_Reservation_system
 Multi-threaded Event Reservation System 

This Application is command line based appliction that supports the booking of multiple Events from multiple requests. This is achieved by using multi-threading and mutex concepts. The requests are generated by the program and are handled using multiple worker threads. The functionality includes checking availability of the seats in a particular event, booking multiple seats, cancelling multiple seats etc. 

The project explores the application of Multi-Threading in Event Reservation system and creates a prototype for the same.
